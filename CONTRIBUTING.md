# Contributing

Contributions to this repository will be very welcome, both in the form of issues or pull-requests ðŸ˜Š

Before starting to work on a particular piece of code, please first open an issue to discuss the change before starting to work on it.

Please note that Elastic does have a [Code of Conduct](https://www.elastic.co/community/codeofconduct).

# Creating an issue

We expect contributors to fill our issue templates when creating new issues. It's important that contributors use those templates appropriately because doing so helps us triage issues more quickly, discuss them more efficiently, and respond to the issue's participants sooner.

For bugs, for example, we expect contributors to provide clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug they've found, and, if possible a screenshot or GIF illustrating the problem. We also appreciate it when contributors can provide information about the bug's cause, even though that's not necessary for reporting a bug.

Once contributors create an issue, this project's maintainers will review and triage it, and we'll aim to get back to the issue's creator as soon as we can, although we can't promise any particular dates.

# Opening a pull-request

Before submitting your PR, ensure it complies with the specs in the issue you're solving, and run both the tests and linting tasks specified in `package.json`. These are required by CI, so they need to be passing before you can merge your pull-request.

When opening a pull-request, make sure to specify which issue it solves, so that the PR and issue get linked. Do the same in your commit messages by adding the issue number to it.

Just like when opening an issue, it's important to fill all the sections in our pull-request templates appropriately, so that we can review your contribution sooner, and provide actionable feedback in less time.

After your issue is opened **and CI is passing**, the team will do its best to review it and get back to you as soon as we can, although we can't commit to a specific timeframe.
